## üõ†Ô∏è Analysis Process

### Step 1: Initial Observation
- Identified the email in my spam folder
- Noticed several red flags:
  - Generic greeting ("Dear Survivalist")
  - Urgent language ("limited first run")
  - "100% free" offer

### Step 2: Header Analysis
- Could not access full headers (common in spam emails)
- Noted missing legitimate sender address

### Step 3: Link Examination
- Hovered over links (without clicking) to reveal:
  - Display text: "Click here to see it in action now"
  - Actual URL: `free-survival-tools[.]biz` (suspicious domain)
  - Used VirusTotal to verify domain reputation

### Step 4: Content Analysis
- Identified psychological triggers:
  - Scarcity tactic ("only have a few left")
  - False urgency ("can't hold yours for long")
  - Social proof request ("forward to someone")

### Step 5: Verification
- Searched for legitimate EDT Mini-Tool - no official product found
- Checked for company registration - none associated with the domain
